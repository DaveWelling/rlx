-   To begin debugging

    -   Be sure your device is attached and usb debugging is enabled
    -   Be sure you are in the rlxNative64 directory of a console
    -   `npm run serve` - this will start your javascript bundling server
    -   open a new console and run `npm run android` - this will build the native app and deploy it to your device
        -   When this finishes, the app will start on the device and request the javascript build from the bundling server
        -   When you make Javascript only changes, you do not need to rerun this (see below). However, if you install a new package that has native elements, you will need to rerun this.
        -   Also, if your adb connection somehow is messed up `npm run android` will usually fix it.
    -   In a browser, open http://localhost:8081/debugger-ui - hit f12 to view the debugging tools. Do not use the reload button in this UI. It sucks and will often lock your app somehow.
    -   In your console: `adb shell input keyevent KEYCODE_MENU`
        -   this will open the debugging menu.
        -   Select the debug option. This will allow you to put breakpoints in the code using the browser ui above. Alternatively, you can put `debugger;` in your code and it will stop there.

-   To just reload some JavaScript changes:
    -   `adb shell input text "RR"`
    -   If you are on a screen with an active text box, this might just type "RR" into the box. In that case:
        -   `adb shell input keyevent KEYCODE_MENU`
        -   Then click the 'Reload' option.
-   To stop the app:
    -   `adb shell am force-stop com.rlxnative64`
-   To start the app (without doing a full build):
    -   `adb shell am start -n com.rlxnative64/com.rlxnative64.MainActivity`
-   To stop the app and clear all data (without uninstalling):
    -   `adb shell pm clear com.silouireactnative`
